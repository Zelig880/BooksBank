    <p>Booksbank is a community driven project, aimed at allowing everyone to be able to enjoy a nice read, by borrowing books that would otherwise sit on a shelf collecting dust.</p>

    <p>The heart of booksbank it's YOU! This project could not be possible, if it wasn't for the thousands of community members that are happy to lent their books.</p>

    <h3>The Story</h3>
    <p>BooksBank is the result of a need that raised during the pandemic that took place in 2020. The main idea was pretty simple. Create a platform that would allow local communities to share books between each other without the need to spend money or lose time having to ship/deliver them.</p>

    <h3>The development</h3>
    <p>The idea was pretty simple, the website development a bit less :)</p>
    <p>Following the first idea Simone (<a class="font-semibold underline" href="www.zelig880.com" target="_blank">Zelig880</a>) started a simple market research between friends and family to get ideas on how to be develop this application</p>
    <p>Following the initial idea, Simone has found some fantastic contributors that have given their time and energy in developing the application that you are using today</p>
