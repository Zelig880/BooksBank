I am going to define the steps necessary to achieve your first PR (or if you are experienced continue being awesome).

## Get started - Join slack

The first and foremost requirement to get started, is to join our slack community. There you will be able to get help you need to install the app (if the provided guide is not enough), and also support in picking your first story and get it out of the door.

Join our Slack community by following this link (it just last 30 days, so if it is expired, let me know on twitter on #zelig880, or by raising an issue on this repo): https://join.slack.com/t/booksbank/shared_invite/zt-qt1f081d-5J3EKVP2T162bTMu~jYAuA

## Onboard

The next step required for you to contribute (if you are a developer), is to get the application up and running locally. You can do so by following the [installation guide](installation.md).

## Before pushing

Please before pushing a pull request ensure:

- The code has passed the required ESLINT and PRETTIER contiguration
