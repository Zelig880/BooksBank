# BookSwap

Welcome to BooksBank, the first project aimed at supporting book lending.

The project goal is to support communities to lend and borrow books between each other, saving themselves money and also allowing people less fortunate to enjoy reading.

The project is runned by Zelig880 (www.zelig880.com), and is open to everyone that wants to contribute.

# How to contribute
The best way to get involved is to find an issue with the label of "Good first issue" or contact me on Twitter (@zelig880). This project is great for people that want to start and learn Vue Js, as I will be reviewing and providing guidance in best practices.

We are aiming at developing Mobile ready components, and trying to replicate the designs as best as we can, taking into consideration the time involved in doing so.
