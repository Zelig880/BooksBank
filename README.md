# BookSwap

Welcome to BooksBank, the first open source project aimed at supporting book lending.

The project goal is to support communities to lend and borrow books between each other, saving themselves money and also allowing people less fortunate to enjoy reading.

The idea behind the project started during the Covid19 lockdown, when I had lots of time on my hand to read books. After a period a found myself spending a lot of money buying books, that ended up on a shelf, collecting dust. Long story short, I started to borrow my books and lend some from my friends.

Now imagine the above situation, and having the possibility to find the book you wanted, within your community, and be able to borrow for free! 

Hopefully as the project grows, it will be able to not only help few people giving a second life to their book, but also help people that may not have the financial possibilities to buy books to get access to them freely (for example university book and very expensive titles not provided by libraries).

The project is runned by Zelig880 (www.zelig880.com), and is open to everyone that wants to contribute.
